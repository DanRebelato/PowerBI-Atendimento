# 📊 Demand and Budget Goals Monitoring Report by Segment - Power BI

This project presents a Power BI dashboard focused on monitoring demand fulfillment and budget goal achievement within a multinational telecommunications company.  
The data and names used have been altered but simulate a real performance management scenario adopted during that period.

## 🧩 About the Project

The goal of this report is to provide a consolidated view of the main fulfillment and budget indicators, enabling decision-making and actions based on the evolution of each segment over the weeks.

## 🧩 About the Data

> ⚠️ Due to confidentiality reasons, the original data used in this project is not available for review or sharing.

The Excel dataset used in this dashboard was generated from a complete **extract, transform, and load (ETL)** process involving:

- Extraction of raw data via **SAP**, from various modules and operational reports;
- Processing and cross-referencing with internal supplementary spreadsheets, using **advanced Excel** (formulas, pivot tables, data cleansing);
- Final consolidation into a single file, which served as the source for modeling and visualization in Power BI.

Although intermediate and original files are not included in this repository, the current dataset accurately simulates the structure and logic used in the original project.

- Power BI Desktop  
- Excel (preliminary treatment and base for Power BI)
